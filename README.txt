The files needed to run this code are 'assignment2.py', 'agentframework.py', 'raster.txt' and 'Results.txt'.

When this folder is opened please open both the assignment2.py and agentframework.py files in spyder (or another python 
console). Once the code has been opened it can be run immediately. Once the assignment2.py code is run a plot will be seen
in the plots section and the environment values will be printed in the console. Furthermore, the Results.txt file will
have the environment values written in it for the most recent run, this file can be opened after one run. There should 
be no issue in the code that has been written and it should run as attended. 


The ProjectReport.docx file found in this repository contains the report of this model following the guidance of the 
assignment outline.

A license has been included but unfortunately I was not able to find out exactly what should be written. I have read some
other free to use software licenses and written what I think is suitable. Apologies if this is not what is intended.

If, for any reason, these files can't be accessed from this folder, please go to this web address to view the files in my
GIThub repository:
